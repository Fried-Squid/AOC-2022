# AOC-2022
Advent of Code solutions for 2022, written in python.

Data for each challenge goes in /data/day{n}.txt

Challenge solutions should contain `solve_p1(data: list) -> Any` and `solve_p2(data: list) -> Any`.

The main python file is used to execute a day's solution.

The getter gets the data for a day, and makes the empty python file.
